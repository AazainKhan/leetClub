## Purpose
As we prepare to transition from college to our professional careers, we are often faced with technical assessments that take place when we apply to our desired jobs. For software engineering roles, a technical assessment could consist of "LeetCode"-style problems where you solve a problem using your desired language and verbally explain your problem-solving methodology. Problems based on data structures and algorithms with easy, medium, and hard difficulties.

While centennial students enrolled in software-related programs have the DSA course in their 2nd year (4th semester), we believe getting 'hands-on' experience through collaboration from experienced or unexperienced students builds confidence in the code we write and develops problem-solving skills, leading to confidence in the roles we aim for professionally. A club where students collaborate to solve LeetCode problems, share their solutions with other students, and have the opportunity to receive feedback.
